My first large project and my coding tutorial space, I have created with
Praesterno foundation (for which I worked) in mind. I wanted its
appearance to evoke a sense of security and peace.
This project tought me a lot, especially when I had to create
accesibility sidebar.
Key features include a responsive design, accesibility sidebar, image
slider and popups.
